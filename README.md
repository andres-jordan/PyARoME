# PyARoME
Python interface to the ARoME library (http://www.astro.up.pt/resources/arome/). The interface uses an old Numpy C API which is deprecated, but it still works. The ARoME library is described in the following paper: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2013A&A...550A..53B/abstract


Installation
------------

To compile the module simply do:

	`python setup.py install`

There is a test file `test.py` included that illustrates the usage and can be used to check that things work allright. To run that test file you will also need to install the `ajplanet` module.
