# PyARoME
Python interface to the ARoME library. The interface is done using an old Numpy C API which is deprecated, but it still works. 


Installation
------------

To compile the module simply do:

	`python setup.py install`

There is a test file 'test.py' included that illustrates the usage. To run that you will also need to install the `ajplanet` module.
